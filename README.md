# A Finance Studentâ€™s Thoughts

This project focuses on pricing options, derivatives, and structured products through Monte Carlo simulations. It involves generating underlying asset paths using various stochastic models and estimating fair prices based on simulated trajectories.

* **Simulation of Underlying Asset Paths**: Implement different models (e.g., Black-Scholes, Heston, Local Volatility) to simulate asset price movements.
* **Cholesky-Based Correlation Handling**: Generate correlated asset paths for multi-asset derivatives.
* **Monte Carlo Pricing**: Use Monte Carlo methods to estimate option values with statistical accuracy.
* **Structured Product Valuation**: Extend pricing to structured financial instruments.
